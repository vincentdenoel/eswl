Thank you for referencing this paper if you found this information useful.

This material has been keynote-presented in Florence during the 16th International Conference on Wind Engineering.

The code is organized in three main blocks.

# --------------------------- #
# 			BLOCK 0		 	  #
# --------------------------- #

Block 0 is designed for performing a buffeting analysis on a structural model subjected to wind loads.

- Initialization
- The addpath function adds custom toolsets and data directories to the MATLAB search path. These are required for 
  structural and stochastic dynamics.
- Load Finite Element Model:
    The load finite_element_model command loads pre-existing structural data and matrices. These include stiffness (K),
    mass (M), and damping (C) matrices, along with other structural details like node coordinates, element connectivity,
    degrees of freedom (DOFs), and observed DOFs.
- Conditional Buffeting Analysis:
    The redo_analysis flag determines if the buffeting analysis should be re-run.
    If redo_analysis is set to 1, the following steps occur:
      Wind Model Definition: Key parameters for the wind model are defined, including wind speed, turbulence intensity,
      and length scales.
      Aero-Structural Model Definition: The aerodynamic and structural properties of the system (e.g., deck width, 
      drag coefficient, and damping ratios) are specified.
      Buffeting Analysis: The do_buffeting_analysis function is called to compute the system's response to wind loads.
    The results are stored in SimResults.mat if the analysis is re-done.
	Notice that the existing SimResults.mat file might be erased.

Overall, this script sets up the model and, if needed, re-computes the Equivalent Static Wind Load (ESWL),
based on updated wind and structural parameters.


# --------------------------- #
# 			BLOCK 1		 	  #
# --------------------------- #


Block 1 performs structural and stochastic dynamic analyses using pre-computed simulation results of block 0.


- Initialization (Color settings are configured using cmp = get(groot,'DefaultAxesColorOrder');.)
- Loading Simulation Results:
    The results from a previous simulation are loaded (load SimResults.mat).
    Variables stored within the structure results are extracted and stored in the workspace for easier access
    using a loop over the field names. See descriptions below for more information on variables used.
- Plotting some Power Spectral Density (PSD):
	  The code selects a few observed Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) from the structural model (iDOF_obs = 
	  structuralModel.iDOF_obs([2 4 6]);).
	  It plots the PSD of displacements for specific spans (2nd, 4th, 6th) using plotTF.
- Covariance Plotting (CPT) Modes:
	  The eigenvectors of the nodal covariance matrix (Vf) are computed.
	  The first seven eigenmodes are plotted, showcasing the structural modes of the system.
- Equivalent Static Wind Loads (ESWL):
	  For selected modes, the ESWLs are computed and plotted (plot_diagrams) based on the computed eigenmodes
	  and the observed DOFs. These loads represent the static forces equivalent to the dynamic effects of wind.
- Load-Response Correlation (LRC) Analysis:
	  The code computes the Load-Response Correlation (LRC) by calculating the correlation between the response
	  and aerodynamic drag forces. It reconstructs the displacements (x_reconstruct) and scales the results appropriately.
	  Both time-domain and frequency-domain methods are used to compute and plot the LRC.
- Envelope Calculation and Comparison:
	  The maximum envelope of displacements (x_env) and moments (m_env) is calculated to represent the extreme response.
      The code defines a metric to quantify the accuracy of the envelope reconstruction and plots the convergence rates.
- Convergence Plots (reconstruction rates):
	  Three different approaches (PSWL, naive, and fastest descent) are used to compute the convergence of the envelope 
	  reconstruction rate. For each approach, the reconstruction rate is plotted, showing how well the computed
	  displacements and moments match the target results.

Overall, this script carries out complex structural dynamic analyses, focusing on computing and visualizing the dynamic response of the system under wind loads. It utilizes precomputed simulation results, extracts key information, and compares different reconstruction approaches for the dynamic behavior of the structure.

# --------------------------- #
# 			BLOCK 2		 	  #
# --------------------------- #

Block 2 performs and displays the convergence plots involving PSWL.

- Initialization
- Loops over combinations of trial runs (14 combinations), where random coefficients are generated and tested for each.
- Reconstruction Process:
    For each trial, you're generating coefficients for trial_eswl, running the plot_diagrams function (likely generating
	plots of some structural response), and calculating reconstruction rates based on environment limits.
    The best trial is selected based on a reconstruction rate and the coefficients and results are stored.
- Plotting and Visualization:
    Subplots (figure(100)) are used to display results for each combination of trials, including the environment bounds
	and the maximum values from your target results (ESWLresults.z_max). Another plot is created to visualize 
	reconstruction rates.
- Final Visualization:
    We also end by contour plotting of weighted combinations of w1 and w2 values, related to scale and the computed 
	reconstruction rates, with proper scaling based on the weights.
